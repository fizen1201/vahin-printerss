## Architecture: Domain-Driven Design

### Core Principles

- Domain logic is the heart of the application
- Entities have identity and lifecycle
- Value objects are immutable and compared by value
- Aggregates enforce consistency boundaries
- Repositories abstract persistence
- Domain events capture things that happened
- Ubiquitous language shared between code and stakeholders

### Layer Rules

**Domain**: Core business logic
- No dependencies on other layers
- Pure business logic
- Entities encapsulate rules
- Value objects immutable

**Application**: Use cases and orchestration
- Only depends on Domain
- Use case implementations
- Port interfaces defined
- No direct infrastructure

**Infrastructure**: External concerns
- Implements port interfaces
- Database repositories
- External API integrations
- Framework-specific code

**Presentation**: User interface
- Depends on Application layer
- HTTP request/response handling
- DTO/domain mapping
- External input validation

## Code Examples

**Server Action**

```typescript
'use server'

import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache';
import { createProjectUseCase } from '@/server/services/project-service';

export async function createProject(formData: FormData) {
  const name = formData.get('name') as string;
  await createProjectUseCase.execute({ name });
  revalidatePath('/projects');
}
```

**API Route Handler**

```typescript
import { NextRequest } from 'next/server';

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const projects = await projectRepository.findAll();
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(projects), {
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  });
}
```

## Anti-Patterns to AVOID

- **Anemic Domain Model**: Entities with only getters/setters, no behavior
  - Fix: Add business logic methods to entities
- **Domain Layer Database Dependency**: Domain entities importing ORM decorators or database types
  - Fix: Keep domain entities pure, use mappers in infrastructure
- **Leaking Domain Logic**: Business rules implemented in controllers or services outside domain
  - Fix: Move business rules into domain entities or domain services

## Responsibilities

- Create psychological safety for creative exploration
- Guide users through proven creativity techniques
- Build momentum through enthusiastic facilitation
- Capture and organize ideas without judgment
- Transform wild ideas into actionable plans

## Governance

All work must respect principles in: `.waypoint/constitution.md`
